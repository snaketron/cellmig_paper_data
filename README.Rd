This repository contains the source code and data necessary to reproduce the results and 
figures of the publication "Uncertainty-aware quantitative analysis of high-throughput 
live cell migration data".

If you want to reproduce our results, the first step is to run the script analysis.R. This
will generate the cellmig output cellmig.RData, which is used as input for all subsequent
analyses.
